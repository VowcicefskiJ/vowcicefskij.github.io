                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to my Computer Science capstone ePortfolio!</strong> This collection represents my growth and learning over three years in the SNHU Computer Science program. Through these projects, I've discovered my passion for intelligent systems and robotics while developing the technical skills needed for a successful career in computer science.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program, I have transformed from someone who could write basic functional code to a developer who understands how to build sophisticated, secure, and scalable applications. My coursework has taught me that good software isn't just about making things workâ€”it's about creating maintainable, secure systems that can grow and adapt. This portfolio demonstrates the technical and professional skills I've gained, particularly in areas that align with my career interests in embedded systems, automation technology, and drone systems.</p>

                <div class="skills-grid">
                    <div class="skill-card">
                        <h4>Working in Teams & Communication</h4>
                        <p>Through my coursework, I learned how important it is to write code that other people can understand and work with. My MVVM architecture project taught me how to organize code so that team members can easily contribute without breaking existing functionality.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="skill-card">
                        <h4>Technical Communication</h4>
                        <p>I developed my ability to explain complex technical concepts through documentation, code comments, and presentations. Writing these project narratives helped me practice communicating my thought process and technical decisions clearly.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="skill-card">
                        <h4>Problem-Solving with Algorithms</h4>
                        <p>My understanding of algorithms grew significantly through implementing data structures like binary search trees and learning template programming in C++. I now approach problems by thinking about efficiency and choosing the right tools for each situation.</p>

                    <div class="skill-card">
                        <h4>Modern Development Practices</h4>
                        <p>I learned to use current technologies and frameworks like Jetpack Compose for Android, Firebase for cloud integration, and modern security practices. These skills prepared me for working in today's development environments.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="skill-card">
                        <h4>Security-First Thinking</h4>
                        <p>Through implementing password hashing and input validation, I developed an understanding of why security matters and how to build it into applications from the start, rather than adding it as an afterthought.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h3>Technical Skills I've Developed</h3>
                <p>My coursework has given me hands-on experience with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full-Stack Development:</strong> MEAN stack applications and understanding how all the pieces work together</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Structures & Algorithms:</strong> Learning when and how to use different approaches for optimal performance</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Programming:</strong> Writing code that protects user data and prevents common vulnerabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile Development:</strong> Building Android apps using modern architecture patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> From basic SQL queries to implementing complex analytics systems</li>

                <h2>My Career Goals and Professional Readiness</h2>
                
                <h3>Where I Want to Go: Intelligent Systems & Robotics</h3>
                <p>The skills I've developed through these projects directly support my career goals in robotics and autonomous systems:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> My C++ experience with memory management and performance optimization prepares me for resource-constrained environments</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Systems:</strong> Understanding algorithmic efficiency helps me write code that responds quickly enough for control systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Connected Devices:</strong> My database and cloud integration experience supports IoT development</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety-Critical Applications:</strong> My focus on security and testing practices is essential for autonomous systems where failures can be dangerous</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>How I'm Prepared for Professional Work</h3>
                <p>Through this program, I've learned skills that will help me contribute to development teams immediately:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing clean, maintainable code that other developers can understand and extend</li>
                    <li>Implementing security best practices from the beginning of projects</li>
                    <li>Choosing appropriate algorithms and data structures for different performance requirements</li>
                    <li>Working with databases to create applications that provide real business value</li>
                </ul>
